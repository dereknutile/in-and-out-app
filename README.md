# In and Out Application

In-and-out status tracking application.  It is built upon the [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) framework and the application mockup can be found in the [https://github.com/dereknutile/in-and-out-mockup](https://github.com/dereknutile/in-and-out-mockup) repository.

## Development

The virtual machine uses my [Laravel Bootstrapper](https://github.com/dereknutile/laravel-bootstrapper) as the foundation.  To setup the development environment, setup the [requirement](https://github.com/dereknutile/laravel-bootstrapper#requirements) and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/dereknutile/laravel-bootstrapper#installation).
